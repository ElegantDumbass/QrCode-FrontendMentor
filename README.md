## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot of things mostly about media query, vw, vh, vmax, vmin, and a little bit about font

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .card {
    height: 78vmin;
    width: 50vw;
  }

  .image {
    padding: 15px 15px 0px 15px;
  }

  .image img {
    height: 45vmin;
    width: 45vw;
  }

  .text h2 {
    margin: 15;
    font-size: 3.3vw;
  }

  .text p {
    font-size: 2.5vw;
  }
}
```

i learned that if you want to make a web responsive to mobile you use (max-width: 600px)
why 600px? because that is what the majority of mobile phone width

### Continued development

My code shows that i am inexperienced and a total begginer(ironic considering i have learned web dev for a long time)
i want to improve my understanding of media query and relative size(kinda still confuse me)

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I am not as skilled as i think i am, if not for ai i dont know how long this would take, i want to be better at web dev and this first step really help me get out of my bubble.

i changed things and added thing from abdul and kusboo feedback
such as :

1. Added Semantic
2. Added Alt(wich i forgot, thankyou)
3. Remove media query(i still don't have clean grasp of it, if any of you have advice or solution please do tell me)
4. Changed color, text weight, and image

if my text is still going outside of the container or it size does not match please do tell me with solution(because frankly i don't know how to fix it)

thank you for the feedback, i will revisit this challange in the future
